<i>This documents version 1.1.0 of the application.</i>

<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>This application provides a canvas on which to draw a higher-order
<a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve">Bézier curve</a>
by successively defining the vertices of its control polygon.</p>

<h1>Requirements</h1>

<p>You will need a Java runtime environment on your system,
preferably Sun Java v1.6 ("Java 6") or higher.
The application has not been tested with other versions or manufacturers.
Additionally, be sure to download or compile the appropriate JAR file for
your system&mdash;32-bit and 64-bit Java do not work together.</p>

<h1>Running</h1>

<p>Run the <tt>timmcHW3-standalone.jar</tt> file by double-clicking on it
or by running <tt>java -jar timmcHW3-standalone.jar</tt> from
the parent directory on the command line.</p>

<h1>Usage</h1>

<img id="screencap-main" src="screencap-main.png"
     alt="Screen capture of program in use.">

<p>At right is a representative screen capture of the application in use.
The tool panel on the left portion of the window contains a set of viewport
positioning tools, and the remaining space to the right is a canvas on which
you may create and modify Bézier curves. There is also a menubar at the top.</p>

<p>Single clicks on the canvas produce new vertices (drawn in green)
that are appended to the end of the control polyline (or "polygon".)
The polyline is drawn in blue. (Full color vision is not required to use this
application; the colors are mentioned here for ease of discussion only.)
When there are more than 2 vertices on the polyline, the resulting Bézier curve
is drawn onto the canvas (in red) using de Casteljau's algorithm.
Existing points may be dragged across the canvas to reposition them,
and the entire image is updated in realtime during the action.</p>

<p>Addition and repositioning of vertices may both be undone and redone in the
standard fashion. The Spline menu contains Undo and Redo buttons and shows their
keyboard shortcuts.
It also contains a Clear command, deleting all vertices at once,
which is also undoable and redoable.</p>

<p>The viewport may be rotated or zoomed using the spinners in the Position
panel. Additionally, dragging the canvas will move the viewpoint as indicated.
If you lose track of the curve by zooming in too far or dragging, the Best Fit
button will reposition the viewpoint to show the polygon again.</p>

<p>Although there is not yet a render/export feature, the View menu does
contain a toggle with which to hide the control polygon. Screen captures may
then be taken with standard software.</p>

<p>You may exit the program by closing the window, using the Spline -&gt; Exit
menu item, or using the menu item's keyboard shortcut.</p>

<h1>Known bugs</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Zooming in to 7.5 or higher can produce jagged curves</li>
  <li>Using Best Fit when all vertices are exactly on the same vertical
      or horizontal can throw the program into an unusable state, although
      Exit will still work.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Future work</h1>

<p>The primary lacking feature at this moment is a suite of export tools,
including such targets as SVG and PNG renders as well as a JSON export
of the control polygon.</p>

<p>If the application is extended to support splines
(continuously joined Bézier curves)
then it will be possible to add curve splitting and joining.</p>

<p>Finally, the ultimate goal is to produce an Iterated Function System (IFS)
based on Bézier curves.
There is not a clear path to this goal,
but the above features will support the work.</p>
