<i>This documents version 1.0.0 of the application.</i>

<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>This application provides a canvas on which to draw a higher-order
Bézier curve by successively defining the vertices of its control polygon.</p>

<h1>Running</h1>

<p></p>

<h1>Future work</h1>

<p>The primary lacking feature at this moment is a suite of export tools,
including such targets as SVG and PNG renders as well as a JSON export
of the control polygon.</p>

<p>If the application is extended to support splines
(continuously joined Bézier curves)
then it will be possible to add curve splitting and joining.</p>

<p>Finally, the ultimate goal is to produce an Iterated Function System (IFS)
based on Bézier curves.
There is not a clear path to this goal,
but the above features will support the work.</p>
